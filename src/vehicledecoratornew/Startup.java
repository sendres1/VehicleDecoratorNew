/**
* Decorator pattern to 
 * handle vehicle sales with varying vehicles and options. This version
 * implements the Decorator Pattern and proves to be a huge improvement in
 * maintainability. No rigidity here ... you can add new options classes
 * or change existing ones without breaking code. You can add new vehicles
 * and not break code. (Note: prices are hard-coded in right now, but they
 * don't have to be ... they can come from a properties file or database.
 *
 * P.S. How would you implement a CashRegister class with this version,
 * without adding rigidity?
