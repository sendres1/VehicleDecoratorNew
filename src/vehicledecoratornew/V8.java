/**
 * A Decorator implementation. Notice that a decorator has a Vehicle 
 * component -- that's the secret to how a decorator works -- it combines 
 * data from the component with data from itself. In this example it gets
 * the cost by adding its own, plus that of the vehicle. And it gets its
 * description by combining its own with that of the vehicle.
